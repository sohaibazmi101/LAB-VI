# **Problems**

#1 Install IDLE interpreter for Python programming.

#2 Use interactive Shell to print the Hello
 Example: print ‘Hello, World’

#3 Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator i.e., Use interactive shell to perform the following operations

+ 3, 5*3, 7-2, 6/2, 6/4, 6%4, 6%2, 2*4-3, 4-2*6-4


#4 Define Variable First name and last name which consists of your first and last names respectively.

#5 Write a program to print your full name using single print statement.

#6 Write a program in Python programming and save it firstProgram.py to perform the following operations:

+ 3, 5*3, 7-2, 6/2, 6/4, 6%4, 6%2

#7 Write a program in Python programming and save it second Program.py to display the following messages:

“Hello World, Python is High level, General-purpose Programming language”
“Guido Van Rossum invented the Python programming language in 1990s”

#8 Write a program to compute the value of following algebraic expression- 
ax5 + bx4+ cx3 + dx2 + ex + f

The values of coefficients are as follows a, b, c, d, e, f = 5, -4, 2, 4, 3, 9

The value of x will be read using input () function.

#9 Write a program to compute the value of following algebraic expression-
The value of x and y will be read using input () function.

#10 Write a program to read an integer and use bitwise operators to multiply it by 2
(<< operator).
