Python Program to Find the Union of two Lists
Python Program to Find the Intersection of Two Lists
Python Program to Create a List of Tuples with the First Element as the Number and Second Element as the Square of the Number.
Assume that the variable data refers to the string “Python rules!”.
Use a string method to perform the following tasks:
Obtain a list of the words in the string.
Convert the string to uppercase.
Locate the position of the string “rules”.
Search a given character.
Replace the exclamation point with a question mark.
Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
Write a Python program to reverse the order of the characters in the given string.
Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string.
Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string: My name is Michele. Then the output will be: Michele is naming My. Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
