# **WEEK 7**

**To learn definite iteration (For loop) and conditional iteration (While loop) in Python.**
**To learn the Conditional (if), Alternative (if-else), break and pass statements in Python.**
**To learn the recursion, flow of execution, infinite recursion in Python.**

## **After completing this, the students would be able to:**

**To write, debug and run a simple Python function based on iteration and recursion.**

## **PROBLEMS**

1. Write a program in Python to check a number for Armstrong. (while) 

2. Write a program in Python to print factorial of a number (for)

3 Write a program in Python to generate first n Fibonacci terms recursively. (function)

4 Write a program in Python to compute factorial of an integer n recursively. (function)

5 Write a program in Python that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. (Without recursion)
